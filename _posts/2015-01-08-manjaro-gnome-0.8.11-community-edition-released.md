title: Manjaro Gnome 0.8.11 community edition released
---
![][1]

Just a quick note that our Gnome community edition installation media has been updated. This edition now provides Gnome in a highly vanilla state with only the baseline Manjaro tools, which we believe is the best long-term installation media solution for this particular DE.

This release comes with Gnome 3.14 series and all the usual Manjaro and upstream updates.

kind regards

Rob McCathie Manjaro Development Team
